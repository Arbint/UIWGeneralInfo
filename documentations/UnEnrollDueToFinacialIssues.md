# Withdraw from the University Due to Financial Issues

First, always Recommend the student to talk to the Financial Aid office if they have not already:

* See what their options are, maybe there are ways to solve the financial issue.
* Discuss how withdrawing will affect their financial aid.


```Financial aid is always overwhelmed with visitors, so best way to get to them is go there physically, but they can alway try email finaid@uiwtx.edu or phone (210) 829-6008.```

## Withdraw timing:
* If the student is only taking a semester off they do not need to reapply to UIW, they will just need to set up a meeting with UAC (Katherine) later in the semester and help the student to register for the next semester. 

* If they take a full year off they will need to reapply to the university.

## Withdraw Steps:
If they you need to withdraw this semester, ask the student to contact our Student Success Office to formally withdraw. they can reach them at academicsupport@uiwtx.edu or (210) 805-5813. (Always needed)
Include in their email:

* Subject Line Format: Withdrawal [Year Term] (e.g., 2025 Fall, Spring, or Summer): Full Name, Student ID Number
* A brief reason for withdrawing
* Contact phone number
* UIW or Personal email address 

If theyâ€™re planning to transfer to another school they can request their transcript from the Registrar's Office through their website: https://my.uiw.edu/registrar/transcript-request.html 


## Credits:
They will always have their completed credits, no matter how much time they take off.
