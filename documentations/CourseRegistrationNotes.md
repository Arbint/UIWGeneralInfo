* We've swapped Creative Writing for Drawing I. HOWEVER, if they already have credit for Drawing I - no need to take Creative Writing.

* We've swapped Media Literacy for Psychology. HOWEVER, if they already have credit for Psychology (or any other social science), they don't need to take Media Literacy.

* Tools for Production Management is for Juniors and Seniors only. However, if there is a Junior or Senior who is not a Prod Man major or minor, they can still take the course.
