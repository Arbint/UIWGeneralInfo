# International Student Online Course

If need to take online course, an ```Online Course Enrollment Reuqest Form``` is needed to be sent to the ```Internation Student and Scholar Service```:

* Ask Connell, Sheena M. <sconnell@uiwtx.edu> to start to form

* Once approved, ask the UAC(University Advising Center) Advisor (Kuehne, Katherine L. <kkuehne@uiwtx.edu>) to remove the restriction for the student.

* If UAC is not available, you as the student academic advisor should also be able to override it. Be sure to keep the approved form.

```NOTE:```
Ayres, Haley C. <ayres@uiwtx.edu> (Sr. Academic Advisor) can also help with the situation, if Katherine is not available.
