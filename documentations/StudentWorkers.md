# Student Work Study & Employees

### Defination:

|Type| Meaning|Budget|
|--|--|--|
|Work Study| Student Who Granted FAFSA, need to ask if they are eligibal | None Department budget, always prefer work study over student employee, we can support 4, there is a limit per student workstudy($4000) but if the hours goes beyond that limit, department budget needs to be used, the limit clears each semester.|
|Student Employee|Students who are not eligible for work study |Department budget, we have around $3000, should be able to support one if needed, but favor work study if possible|

### Composition

We hire student workstudy and employees each semeter. The composition is usually:

1 Animation Tutor, 1 Modeling Tutor, 1 Programming Tutor, 1 AV and Tutor, basically 1 tutor for each track, and an addtional one for Audio/Video setup in seminar and other events, but can also serve as a wild card tutor.


### Timing

Hiring takes weeks to be processed, general timeline:

Around Spring Break / Fall Break

- Post Jobs for the next semester (Victoria)
- Faculty find candidates 
- Students Applying ASAP
- Do the interviews
- Finish Hiring


### Notes
* The proces to get a student hired can takes weeks, start ASAP. Prior Student Workstudy and Employees are faster.

* All suitable applicants need to be properly interviewed.
