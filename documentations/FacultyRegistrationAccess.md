# Gain Accesss to Student Course Registration on B9

Registration access is not always needed:

* Faculty can check registration history in SFARHST
* Faculty also have access to SFASRPO when you are approval overrides

Faculty do not currently have access to SFAREGS to register students directly in B9 Admin. You would need to submit the system access request to EA via the AdobeSign process

Lisl N Eichorn. eichorn@uiwtx.edu helped us getting access to register students for the ABM students. Should reach out to her for help if needed.
