# Gain Accesss to Student Course Registration on B9

Lisl N Eichorn. eichorn@uiwtx.edu helped us getting access to register students for the ABM students.

Registration access is not always needed:

* Faculty can check registration history in SFARHST
* Faculty also have access to SFASRPO when you are approval overrides
